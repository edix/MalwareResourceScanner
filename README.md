Malware Resource Scanner
=======================
Malware Resource Scanner can identify PE files which are hidden in other PE file resources which are encrypted by an XOR key (up to an 8 Byte key). You can scan single files and you can also scan a directory and automatically unpack found hidden PE files. If MSR can't detect your hidden PE file then you must update the g_SearchInfoArray in ResourceParser.h.
