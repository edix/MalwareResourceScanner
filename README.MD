Malware Resource Scanner
=======================
Malware Resource Scanner can identify PE files which are hidden in other PE file resources which are encrypted by an XOR key (up to an 8 Byte key). You can scan single files and you can also scan a directory and automatically unpack found hidden PE files. If MSR can't detect your hidden PE file then you must update the g_SearchInfoArray in ResourceParser.h which looks right now like this:
	const SearchInfo g_SearchInfoArray[] = 
	{ 
		{0x00505a4d, 4},	// Delphi
		{0x00905a4d, 4},	// C / Assembler
		{0x00005a4d, 4},
		{0x0000000200505a4d, 8},
		{0x0000000300505a4d, 8},
		{0x0000000000505a4d, 8}
	};
